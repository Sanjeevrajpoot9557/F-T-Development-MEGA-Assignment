        <h1 style="background-color: aqua;">Food in Ireland</h1>
        <p> <strong>These are some of my favourite Irish foods! </strong></p>
        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(28, 130, 130);">Traditional Irish Breakfast</h2>
        <p> A "Full Irish" breakfast consists of sausages, rashers
            (bacon), eggs, black pudding, white pudding
            and toast.
        </p>
        <p> Often there will be a grilled tomato as well as mushrooms,
            and baked beans. </p>
        <p> And of course, no breakfast is complete without a lovely pot
            of tea! </p>
        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(28, 145, 145);">Bangers and Mash</h2>
        <p> This classic of sausages, mashed potato and gravy is not
            
            unique to Ireland, but what makes it special is the
            Irish
            sausages. Most countries have their own way of making
            sausages,
            and they are one thing I miss from home if I'm away
            travelling!
        </p>
        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(38, 134, 134);">Bacon and Cabbage</h2>
        <p> I couldn't possibly make a list of Irish food without
            including this very traditional dish! </p>
        <p> It might not sound very interesting, but this hearty
            meal of
            boiled ham, potatoes and green cabbage is tasty and filling.
            I love to smother the potatoes in butter, and I also
            like a
            little mustard with the bacon.
        </p>
        <p> My mum always made it extra special by cooking the
            cabbage in the water that the ham was boiled in.
        </p>
        <p> If there are any leftovers you can make another one of
            my favourites: <strong>fried cabbage</strong>!
